Origin
======
By Doohl.

Origin is a relatively ambitious, yet massively unfinished C++ project. It started off as a simple concept for an open world sandbox survival roguelike loosely based off of an idea I had for a novel. This idea has since fleshed out considerably to the point where the game could be the actual manifestation of the story.

It is unknown whether I will ever find the time or drive to continue work on Origin. The code is a bit of a mess and could use some extensive work, and the monster/object/turf prototyping would be better offloaded to something like JSON or XML. This was my first C++ project, so it's got some very rookie mistakes in it. As it is, it's compilable and semi-playable with the only features being the ability to pick up, equip, and wear items as well as bump into monsters and animals to attack them.

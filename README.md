[DEPRECATED PROJECT]

## Important Note
This project uses Libtcod (or, “The Doryen Library”) version 1.5.2. It has been known to be almost impossible to compile in more recent MinGW versions, so if you want to compile I recommend using an older version. I also make minor use of the Boost libraries, so that is also required for compilation.

Current working compiler specs:
- GCC - v4.5.2
- MinGW32 - v3.18 (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MinGW/Base/mingw-rt/mingwrt-3.18/)
- (GNU Make - v3.82)
- Boost C++ Libraries - Headers Only (http://www.boost.org/)

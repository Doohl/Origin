Origin
======
By Doohl.

Origin is a relatively ambitious, yet massively unfinished C++ project. It started off as a simple concept for an open world sandbox survival roguelike loosely based off of an idea I had for a novel. This idea has since fleshed out considerably to the point where the game could be the actual manifestation of the story.

It is unknown whether I will ever find the time or drive to continue work on Origin. The code is a bit of a mess and could use some extensive work, and the monster/object/turf prototyping would be better offloaded to something like JSON or XML. This was my first C++ project, so it's got some very rookie mistakes in it. As it is, it's compilable and semi-playable with the only features being the ability to pick up, equip, and wear items as well as bump into monsters and animals to attack them.

Important note
=====
This project uses Libtcod (or, “The Doryen Library”) version 1.5.2. It has been known to be almost impossible to compile in more recent MinGW versions, so if you want to compile I recommend using an older version.

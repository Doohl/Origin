Origin
======
By Doohl.

Origin is an unfinished roguelike based off a vague story idea conceptualized in the dark mind of a highschooler. In its core it will be designed to simulate surviving on an alien world, trying to prepare for the unexpected and unpredictable. Most games try to have a serious, dark atmosphere focused on realism, but not Origin; Origin focuses on the fun factor whilst retaining a grim yet wacky environment where nothing can really be taken seriously.

The game's not very fleshed out yet and so far the only thing I have to show is a functional roguelike engine, but that's about it.

Important note
=====
This project uses Libtcod (or, “The Doryen Library”) version 1.5.2. It has been known to be almost impossible to compile in more recent MinGW versions, so if you want to compile I recommend using an older version. I also make minor use of the Boost libraries, so that is also required for compilation.

Current working compiler specs:
- GCC - v4.5.2
- MinGW32 - v3.18 (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MinGW/Base/mingw-rt/mingwrt-3.18/)
- (GNU Make - v3.82)
- Boost C++ Libraries - Headers Only (http://www.boost.org/)

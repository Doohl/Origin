A single-player 2D ASCII roguelike created by Doohl, all rights reserved. The rights are so reserved they just do not have time for your shit today.

## Origin Game Synopsis

Origin will be a turn-based survival/action 2D ASCII roguelike with a heavy emphasis on the player's ability to adapt and thrive in constantly-challening environments.

The game is set in the very distant future (2700s) in a planet known informally as Origin. The most modern, conventional method of interstellar and intergalactic travel is known as Bluespace, a parallel reality where time and space are only loosely correlated to the primary reality. The mechanics of Bluespace operate in such a foreign and unintuitive way, defying all known principles of modern physics. As such, even in the mid-2500s, extensive research was performed on this dimension. It was established that the Bluespace realm expands outward similar to the primary universe, but from a specific point of Origin.

The player is a member of the a science expedition sent to the Origin of Bluespace; a single planet orbiting a small star. The ship experiences a catastrophic failure and crash-lands into the planet, killing all members of the science team. All except the player.

## Gameplay

Survival - The player is cast away on a foreign planet with no way of escaping or knowing what's in store. They must attempt to feed themselves, survive the hostile environments, and perhaps attempt to explore. Survival is the main factor, as the game will constantly be throwing obstacles at the player which increase in difficulty as their time on the planet increases.

Combat - Combat in Origin shall be relatively simple and yet more complex than hitpoint values and damage numbers. Melee combat, for example, has three basic trauma inflictors: blunt, piercing, and slashing. These values can influence what kind of wounds the player or a monster receives. If something organic is struck by a sword of a variable size, girdth, and strength, they will be inflicted with laceration trauma which can bleed as well as cause pain, lack of mobility, and infections if left untreated.

Crafting - The player will be able to use the strange alien environment to learn what things do and how to put them together. They can craft useful apparatus, tools, and items to assist them in their quest for survival. They can also attempt to find items from crash sites and craft conventional human items such as projectile weaponry or electronics.

Procedurally-Generated World - The game world is procedurally-generated, with different geographic areas adding some variety and challenge to the different areas the player can visit. Possibly, the player will be able to choose their starting position on the worldmap, which is where they crash into. Another possibility is also the world wrapping into itself so there are no seams at the edges. Alternatively the world can be generated as it is needed, allowing for an infinitely-large map.

Insanity - Origin is not a very logical, and consequently safe place. Events in Origin are very much random, confusing, and potentially catastrophic in nature. The player will not be able to reliably predict what will happen, but they should be able to adapt and be prepared to deal with it. For example, the game might decide to animate the furniture in your shack for a brief moment, sending them hurtling toward you and busting holes in your walls that you have to repair. Or you might be attacked by a swarm of fairies casting magic at you, while the trees turn into slime and the sky begins raining hallucinogenic drugs.

Plot - Probably one of the more ambitious gameplay aspects of Origin; the game will have a plot and a story to tell admist the gameplay. The plot will be entirely optional, however; if the player does not choose to indulge in it they do not have to. It will serve as a way to guide new players as well as giving them stuff to do at first, but will eventually branch off into its own involved story with the players' actions molding the narrative as it happens.

## Important Note
This project uses Libtcod (or, “The Doryen Library”) version 1.5.2. It has been known to be almost impossible to compile in more recent MinGW versions, so if you want to compile I recommend using an older version. I also make minor use of the Boost libraries, so that is also required for compilation.

Current working compiler specs:
- GCC - v4.5.2
- MinGW32 - v3.18 (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MinGW/Base/mingw-rt/mingwrt-3.18/)
- (GNU Make - v3.82)
- Boost C++ Libraries - Headers Only (http://www.boost.org/)
